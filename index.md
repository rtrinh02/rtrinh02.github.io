### CPSC 120

* Lab 12
I really enjoyed lab 12 because It felt like it was a combination of all the things that i've learned over the course of the semester combined in one. I really enjoyed learning how to make an animated gif using individual images and constructing them to be one thing. I also really enjoyed learning about the random colored pixels in the background and how we made it come in random times using a nested loop. 

* Lab 09
is up there as one of my favorites because being able to code utilities that can actually improve your daily living is what I eventually want to aim towards. With the spell checker, it was personally difficult to code but when I got it I was very fascinated by the outcome. In this lab I learned about using the programs of the Readwords and Mispelled Words functions to check for improper spelling. That was very cool and interesting to learn. 

* Lab 10
is my favorite lab of all things we've done so far, using code to make a color gradient was very interesting to me. Using different hexidecimals and learning how to make a wave color was very cool. Debugging the code to test different colors was also very interesting. In this lab we combined three channels to create a beautiful gradient. The image contains a smoothly created color in a tge horizontal direction using a loop that changes the red color and another loop to change green and blue. We also used an additional library and that was something I was also unfamiliar with.
