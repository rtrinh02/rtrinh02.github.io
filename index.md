### CPSC 120

* Lab 12
I really enjoyed lab 12 because It felt like it was a combination of all the things that i've learned over the course of the semester combined in one. As such, being able to create things in the terminal like what we had done for this lab is really cool.

* Lab 09
Lab 9 is up there as one of my favorites because being able to code utilities that can actually improve your daily living is what I eventually want to aim towards. With the spell checker, it was personally difficult to code but when I got it I was very fascinated by the outcome.

* Lab 10
Lab 10 is my favorite lab of all things we've done so far, using code to make a color gradient was very interesting to me. Using different hexidecimals and learning how to make a wave color was very cool. Debugging the code to test different colors was also very interesting,
